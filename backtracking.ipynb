    "Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively. It builds a solution incrementally (often one decision at a time) and abandons a branch (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the branch cannot possibly lead to a valid solution. It is especially useful for constraint satisfaction problems, such as puzzles (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku), where you make choices and, if a conflict arises, revert your last decision and try an alternative."

    "2. We use a recursive helper function that places queens row by row rather than column by column, which simplifies the base condition (when row equals N, we've placed all queens).\n",
